### Changelog
*We just released a major update in July 2020!* This release includes the current Vue CLI, async/await instead of promise chaining, and a structure overhaul incorporating updated best practices. The flow remains unchanged with some updates to match the current Firebase SDK. All code for the rewrite can be found in the project's `master` branch, while the old code remains in `original-deprecated` for posterity.

Changelog:

* Complete rewrite of existing project
* Async/Await instead of promise chaining
* More components vs. same file functionality
* Leveraging more actions vs. in-component requests to handle Firebase methods
* Simplified Firebase integration
